# Final Year Project

This project is aimed towards provisioning infrastructure within a cloud environment in a compliant state, and deploys resources with Infrastructure as Code templates.

## Aims

To make the deployment of infrastructure an easier process so that an end user does not need to worry about misconfiguring their resources, as well as spend time learning about cloud services, by developing a provisioner solution.

## Objectives

- To interpret config data (from user) and convert it into infrastructure as code.
- To deploy compliant infrastructure into the cloud.
- To minimise time having to manually configure infrastructure securely.
- To house resources that have been deployed in a Infrastructure as Code template.
- To construct an Infrastructure as Code template that is Cloud Service Provider independent.
